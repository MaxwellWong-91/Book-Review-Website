# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

A book review website that lets users make an account to view and write book review. Allows logged in users to search for a book in our database through book title, author, published date, or year published. Uses Goodreads review api to find average ratings and total reviews for a book. Includes several api endpoints to allow anyone who goes to our website to get book review data.
